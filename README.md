# 🔐 AES Encryption App

An AES Encryption App built using **Flutter** and **GetX** for state management. This app provides secure encryption and decryption of text using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Encrypt text using AES encryption  
✅ Decrypt encrypted text using a secret key  
✅ Generate a QR code containing the encrypted message  
✅ User-friendly interface with smooth animations  
✅ Lightweight and fast with **GetX** state management  
✅ Works entirely offline for security
